Use the following command to get started with this streamlit app:

The Main page gives simple guidance on how the app works

The Connect page sets the conext for where to store the published records. The accompaning SQL scripts must be executed first as they contain the backend pipeline DDL to make the connection to CKAN. The Control table is what tracks the status of the tables which have been published. The context should be set to the database and schema in which you executed the SQL files (i.e. where the Control table is located).

The Existing Tables page allows you to delete records from the Control table. There is a daily process that refreshes the presigned URLs to CKAN. Removing records from the Control table stops this refresh process for those resources and packages.

The Publish page allows the user to insert metadata about the data which will be published to CKAN. These are required fields from CKAN. Upon pressing publish, the external functions will create a package, drop the data to a Snowflake internal stage, and create a resource in the package with a presigned URL back to the data in Snowflake.

The proof is in the pudding. Here's a quick example of the results. But go check it out yourself; after all, it's open!
